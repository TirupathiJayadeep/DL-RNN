# DL- Developing a Recurrent Neural Network Model for Stock Prediction

## AIM
To develop a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model for predicting stock prices using historical closing price data.

## THEORY


## Neural Network Model
Include the neural network model diagram.

## DESIGN STEPS
### STEP 1: 
Load and normalize data, create sequences.

### STEP 2: 

Convert data to tensors and set up DataLoader.

### STEP 3: 

Define the RNN model architecture.

### STEP 4: 
Summarize, compile with loss and optimizer.

### STEP 5: 
Train the model with loss tracking.

### STEP 6: 

Predict on test data, plot actual vs. predicted prices.
